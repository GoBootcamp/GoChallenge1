# Golang Programming Challenge 1

Submit your Golang Programming Challenge Solution via GitHub!

## Here is what to do

_Do the following only on 14th and 15th of the month, not before._

1. Fork this repository
2. Copy the sample folder `example/` to `solution-firstname_middlename_lastname`
3. Edit the `README.md` file and type a good description about your solution and about yourself
4. Replace the `profile_picture.jpg` with a picture of yourself that we can use to list you on blog when you solution wins.
5. Create a pull request of your fork. Consider using firstname_middlename_lastname as the pull request subject, as this makes the list of pull requests enticing to read.

### Notes

Please don't delete the example folder, as this will delete it in master when your pull request gets merged.

You can add any type of assets to support your proposal inside your folder.
When a talk gets accepted we will press the lovely green merge button.

Solutions will be accepted until the midnight of 15th March, 2015 IST.
